Using this library
====================================

Check out `main.py <https://github.com/JarrettR/WPA-Slowed-Down/blob/master/main.py>`_ for a few examples of the top level methods.

Additionally, this library is used in the regression tests for my `VHDL implementation of WPA2 <https://github.com/JarrettR/FPGA-Cryptoparty/FPGA/tests>`_ .

All of the intermediate methods(SHA1, HMAC, PBkDF2, and PRF) are available too, but undocumented at this time.
