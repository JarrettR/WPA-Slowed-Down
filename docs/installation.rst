Installation
====================================

For general usage, you should be able to use ``pip install wpa2slow`` and it will magically work.

Alternatively, clone this repo and install locally. This might be ideal if you intend to "get under the hood" and see how the data moves:
``
git clone https://github.com/JarrettR/WPA-Slowed-Down.git
cd WPA-Slowed-Down
pip install .
``
